# LookingGlass-DarkEngine
Misc. source code for Looking Glass Studios games, leaked back in 2010.

Originated from a Dreamcast Katana devkit. 
It was originally used by Marina Games for testing their two main projects, cancelled Dreamcast ports of Thief 2 and System Shock 2.
The system came bundled with several early builds of System Shock 2 for Dreamcast, files from Thief 2 for Dreamcast, plus source code for the Dark Engine itself.

#### thief_2_service_release
Main repository folder, contains Dark Engine source code along with game specific code for these games:

+ Thief 2 - The Metal Age
+ System Shock 2
+ Deep Cover (unreleased, predates Siege Engine iteration)

#### DarkEngine
Partial archive of Thief: The Dark Project source code.
Contains libraries and code missing from thief_2_service_release, but the libraries are in an older form than what the former archive expects, requiring modification.
